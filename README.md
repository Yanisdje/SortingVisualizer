This Python-based sorting visualizer offers a dynamic and interactive way to understand how sorting algorithms work. Built with Pygame, the visualizer displays a list of randomly generated numbers as vertical bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to the value of the number.

Users can observe the sorting process in real-time with two popular algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. The visualizer allows you to switch between ascending and descending order, reset the list, or start the sorting process with simple keyboard inputs. Each step of the algorithm is clearly visualized with color-coded bars, making it easy to follow the sorting logic.
